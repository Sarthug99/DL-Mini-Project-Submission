**CIFAR-10 Image Classification**\
This repository contains code for training and evaluating convolutional neural network models for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

**Introduction**\
The CIFAR-10 dataset is a widely used benchmark in the field of computer vision. It consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes, with each class containing 6,000 images. The classes include objects such as airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.

**Requirements**\
To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following dependencies:

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* PyTorch
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Pandas

**Usage**

Clone this repository:
```
https://github.com/Sarthug99/DL-Mini-Project-Submission.git
```
Navigate to the repository directory:
```
cd DL-Mini-Project-Submission
```
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```
jupyter notebook
```
Open the __mini-project-submission.ipynb__ notebook and run all the commands to train, evaluate, and test the models.

**Model Architectures**

This repository includes two model architectures for image classification:

* ResNet: A convolutional neural network based on the ResNet architecture.
* Modified ResNet: A modified version of ResNet with additional layers and depthwise separable convolutions.
