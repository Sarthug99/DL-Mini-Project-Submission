**CIFAR-10 Image Classification**\
This repository contains code for training and evaluating convolutional neural network models for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

**Introduction**\
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes are: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.

**Requirements**\
To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following dependencies:

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* PyTorch
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* tqdm

**Usage**

* Clone this repository:
```
https://github.com/Sarthug99/DL-Mini-Project-Submission.git
```
* Navigate to the repository directory:
```
cd DL-Mini-Project-Submission
```
* Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```
jupyter notebook
```
* Open the __mini-project-submission.ipynb__ notebook and run all the commands to train, evaluate, and test the models.

**Model Architectures**

This repository includes two model architectures for image classification:

ResNet: A convolutional neural network based on the ResNet architecture.
Modified ResNet: A modified version of ResNet with additional layers and depthwise separable convolutions.
